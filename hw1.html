					<h2>All Fruits</h2>
					<p>A fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.</p>
					<p>Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.</p>
